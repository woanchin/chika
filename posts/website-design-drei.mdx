# Part 3

Oooof! I haven't updated in a while! No reason in particular, I just got distracted and I felt like a lot of things were coming onto me at once so I just simply ran out of mental energy. I found some small inspiration again and decided to add some more bells and whistles I promised last [post](/posts/website-design-2).

Added Spotify! Yay. I mostly listened to music on Youtube. That is after outgrowing my poor unethical student behavior when I download mp3 _legally_ on gendou and 4shared. And then I saw many next js portfolios with this Spotify widget looking thingy that automatically shows you what the blogger is listening to. And I thought I had to have it.

So very quickly here's how I got the spotify going.

Requisites:

1. You need a spotify dev account. Get one [here](https://developer.spotify.com/)
2. You need
   -SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
   -SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
   -SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN

##Spotify
Go to the dashboard. Create an app. Fill out your app name and details. After that is done, in "EDIT SETTINGS" you want to list http://localhost:3000 as your redirect URIs.

Copy the CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET and keep it handy somewhere. Best to open a code editor page for this. Since you might be copying and pasting a lot of times.

Next we need to get a spotify refresh token. Here's what you need to do.

1. Open a browser. Put in this link:

https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http
%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000&scope=user-read-currently-playing%20
user-top-read

2. After logging in and authorizing, spotify will redirect you back to https://localhost:3000/ because that's what we specified in the "EDIT SETTINGS". We're much more interested in what comes after this url. It should look like /?code=blahblah

3. To get the access token, first you need a Base 64 encoded string of your Client Id and Client secret. Use this [website](https://www.base64encode.org/) and put in

```
YOUR_CLIENT_ID:YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Note the colon in the middle. Press encode and again copy the result into somewhere handy.

4. Open up git-bash or if you already have curl supported... copy the below command and edit accordingly.

curl -H "Authorization: Basic <YOUR_CLIENT_ID:YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET THAT IS BASE 64 ENCODED>" -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code=<THE CODE YOU GOT IN STEP 2> -d redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000 https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token

This should spit out a few things.

1. access token 2) refresh token 3) token_type 4) expiry 5) scope.

5) Copy the refresh token.

##Next js / vercel
at the root level of your project. create a .env.local file and just a note, dont check this into your github? unless you want people to know your clientid clientsecrets hehe.

Paste this into your .env.local file
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=<YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN>

If you are using vercel to deploy. You can go to your vercel project dashboard and under 'Settings', locate 'Environment Variables' and put in the same information.

##Coding time!
This is like working with any API out there. To get familiar with Spotify API and what you can present, you can check out this [link](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/).

Before grabbing any information from spotify, you need to get an access token first. This is a bit simpler than what we did from before. Here's my code for reference!

```js
// lib/spotify.js

async function getAccessToken() {
  const params = { grant_type: "refresh_token", refresh_token: refreshToken };
  const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(params);
  const response = await fetch(TOKEN_ENDPOINT, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Basic ${basic}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    },
    body: searchParams.toString(),
  });
  const jsonReply = await response.json();
  return jsonReply;
}
```

In the jsonReply object, you should have an access_token field. Use the result and run another api call to Spotify to grab song information this time round.

```js
// lib/spotify.js
const NOW_PLAYING_ENDPOINT = `https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/currently-playing`;

export async function getNowPlaying() {
  const accessToken = await getAccessToken();
  return fetch(NOW_PLAYING_ENDPOINT, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken.access_token}`,
    },
  });
}
```

With what we have so far, we have a json displaying our current track, like below

Phew.. really long json but it has everything we need. _Shout out to Men I Trust. their songs are great. would highly recommend._ In particular, the song title and the artist. This is what the code below is doing, grabbing only the essentials. Note: below file is a separate file from the one before. We need to separate the two. Helps with the later part on SWR!

```js
// /api/now-playing.js
import { getNowPlaying } from "../../lib/spotify";

export default async (_, res) => {
  const response = await getNowPlaying();
  const items = await response.json();
  const nowPlaying = items.item.artists.find((e) => true);
  const image = items.item.album.images.find((e) => true);

  const track = {
    artist: nowPlaying.name,
    songUrl: items.item.external_urls.spotify,
    imageUrl: image.url,
    title: items.item.name,
  };

  return res.status(200).json({ track });
};
```

The next part we need is fetching this information real time. Or whenever the page refreshes. The idea is that we don't have the 'currently-playing' song to be outdated! :) To do that, I use vercel's SWR function. It's like magic.

Pardon the messy code, I'm still in the midst of refactoring and figuring out how to organize.

```js
//create a file like this
// /lib/fetcher.js

export default async (...args) => {
  const res = await fetch(...args);
  return res.json();
};
```

```js
// /components/NowPlaying.js
export default function NowPlaying() {
  // /api/now-playing is used here because my file path is /api/now-playing.js and fetcher is imported from fetcher.js
  const { data } = useSWR("/api/now-playing", fetcher);

  //if my spotify is running, it will show what's playing otherwise. it will be defaulted to not playing mode.

  return (
        {data?.track.songUrl ? (
          <Box>
            <Text>Now playing </Text>
            <ChakraLink href={data.track.songUrl}>
              <Text as="i">
                {data.track.title}&ensp;-&ensp;{data?.track.artist}
              </Text>
            </ChakraLink>
          </Box>
        ) : (
          <Text>Not playing Spotify</Text>
        )}
  );
}
```

Ok that was superrrr long. hahaha, brb running out of mental juice again. But I hope this was useful. I realise my code is displayed crappily. Maybe in the next post I will look at improve this.
