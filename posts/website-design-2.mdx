# Part 2

Earlier on, I was trying to get my website up and running. Here are some updates!

I continued to follow tutorials to dress up this blog. See Benjamin Carlson's videos [here](https://youtu.be/lhOvI9s5gQY) and Lee Rob's blogs [here](https://leerob.io/blog) for references. Honestly they have helped me a lot with my limited css html knowledge. I think I spent 15 minutes trying to get the 'Back to Home' aligned somewhat with the blog posts. If I never had their examples and source codes I probably would have taken even longer.

MDX is added! So I have some _styling_... I'll still need to learn markdown to fully utilize mdx. I'm having a lot of fun though :)

My next task would be to add more things to my portfolio. Maybe play around with SWR from vercel and add other bells and whistle. I'm not too happy with how bland my blog looks too, so I'm hoping to add more images. Here's one to close off this post!
