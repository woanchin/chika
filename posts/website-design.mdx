# Yay my first website

This website was made using Vercel, ChakraUI. It was my first time working with these technologies. I'm mainly a backend developer so I was really worried I would be super lost navigating the frontend world. In the end I decided to try out Vercel because it's free and some of the next.js websites I've seen on r/webdevs was what I imagined my own portfolio website would look like.

The registering process on Vercel was as easy as it gets. About 10 minutes later, I got this website working. The domain was picked for me automatically, I re-rolled the process a couple of times to get the domain I'm happy with but you can totally buy your own on the Vercel platform.

_How I designed my UI_

I first learned React in 2016 on my internship in San Francisco. It's still a really long time back so I decided to follow word for word the next.js tutorials on create-nextjs-app. I'm sure you'll be able to notice the similarities as you go through the tutorial.

After establishing the backbone of the website, I started to explore on other UI tricks I could use. Again, r/webdev posts provided inspiration to me and I found ChakraUI. I really like the idea of having dark mode on my website since I work in really dark settings at home.

I followed tutorials on youtube but I'll show a snippet of the code (when i get to implementing the snippets link part haha)

Andddd that's about it, I'm still looking to include more fabulous stuff on my post. But it will do for today.
